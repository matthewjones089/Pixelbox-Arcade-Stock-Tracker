# Pixelbox-Arcade-Stock-Tracker
Custom built Stock and Order tracking and updating software

This software has been built specifically for use by Pixelbox Arcade. (https://pixelboxarcade.com/)

They asked me to create a system that would allow them to keep a record of their stock as well as any orders they currently had.  
I was given a breif set of requirements:

-Items must be able to be added and stored  
-Stock must be able to be added and removed from idividual items  
-A cost per unit must be calculated for each unique item  
-An Item should be able to have a link associated to it to direct to where the item can be purchased

-Bill Of Material's must be able to be created and stored   
-Items must be able to be added to a Bill of Material   
-A visual indicator should show if enough of an Item is available to fulfill a Bill of Material   
-The total cost of a Bill of Material should be shown   

-Orders must be able to be created and stored   
-Individual Items must be able to be added to an Order  
-All of the items in a Bill of Material should be able to be imported into an Order   
-The total cost of an Order should be shown   
-An Order should be able to be "built" where a stock reduction is applied each Item on the order and a stock increase applied to an Item to indicate that it is built
